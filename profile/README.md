# Hurawatch Streaming Access Project ‚Äì 2025 Overview

## Introduction

The **Hurawatch Streaming Access Project** is an open-source initiative designed to explore and improve the experience of discovering and accessing online streaming content through legal and ethical channels.  
Rather than acting as a media host, this project focuses on providing community-driven tools, technical guidance, and API resources to help developers, researchers, and content creators experiment with streaming workflows.

Our mission is to make streaming discovery **simpler, faster, and safer** while respecting copyright laws and promoting the use of legitimate media sources.

## Why the Name "Hurawatch"?

The name is inspired by the idea of **hurrah moments**‚Äîcelebrating when users finally find what they were looking for.  
It is *not* affiliated with any commercial streaming service and does not host or distribute copyrighted material.  
Instead, it exists as a **technology sandbox** for safe and compliant streaming exploration.
